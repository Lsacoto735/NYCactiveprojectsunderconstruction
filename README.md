# NYCactiveprojectsunderconstruction

1) Business Process
2) Requirements: For data in 2024, I want to identify areas with the most active construction projects, this can show areas/regions of growth or educational improvents. I can also understand the projects and contracts to see how this can impact the district or borough. Each record has: project name, brough, district, description, contract number, awarded contract value, construction type, notice to proceed date, substantial completion date, project status, addres,longitude, latitude.
3) Count the number of prjects in each area, calculate the min, max, and average awarded contract value.
   Sort by project type, calculate min, max, and avg awareded contract value.
